socaster-api
============

An api for the social screencasting application implemented using the Eve REST framework


This repo has been cloned on the public sphere: https://github.com/DeveloperLiberationFront/socaster-api.

That api is now the current origin for the live/production code.

If you want to change it back, ssh into the box and run:

`git remote set-url origin git@github.ncsu.edu:schrist/socaster-api.git`
